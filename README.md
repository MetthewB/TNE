# Multi-Platform Neuromuscular Simulation Framework

This project integrates electrical spinal cord stimulation with musculoskeletal simulations to predict **electromyographic (EMG) activity** and **limb kinematics**. It enables cross-platform modeling and analysis of neuromuscular control.

## Features

- Integration of spinal cord stimulation protocols with musculoskeletal models  
- Simulation of muscle activations and joint movements  
- Prediction of EMG signals and limb trajectories  
- Support for multiple simulation platforms (e.g., OpenSim, MuJoCo, MyoSuite)  
- Visualization of neural inputs, muscle synergies, and motor output

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/neuromuscular-sim.git
   cd neuromuscular-sim
````

2. Install dependencies (requirements may vary by backend):

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run simulations or explore notebooks in `notebooks/` for analysis and visualization.

## Applications

* Spinal cord injury rehabilitation research
* Personalized neuromodulation strategies
* Biomechanical and neurophysiological validation of stimulation protocols

## Results

Simulation results, figures, and model outputs are available in the `results/` folder.
